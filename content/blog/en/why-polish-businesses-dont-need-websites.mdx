# Why Polish Small Businesses Don't Need Websites (And Why I'm Building Them Anyway)

I've spent the last month cold-prospecting nail salons and barbers in Częstochowa. 100+ businesses researched. Maybe 15 have proper websites. The rest? Booksy profiles and Instagram accounts. That's it.

When I started [building an AI system to find these businesses](/en/blog/how-i-built-ai-system-find-polish-businesses), I thought the lack of websites was laziness or budget constraints. It's not. It's a deliberate choice rooted in a very specific psychology.

Polish small business owners genuinely believe websites are unnecessary. And I'm starting to understand why.

## The Booksy Fortress

Booksy owns the Polish beauty and wellness market. Not "has a presence." Owns.

If you're a nail salon, barber, or massage therapist in Poland, you're on Booksy. It's not optional. Your clients book through Booksy. They discover you through Booksy. Your calendar lives in Booksy. Your payments run through Booksy.

Why would you need a website when Booksy already handles discovery, booking, payments, and reviews? The platform does everything a website would do, except you don't have to build it or maintain it.

From the business owner's perspective, a website is redundant infrastructure. I've read this exact sentiment in my research notes at least 20 times. "Already on Booksy."

The logic is sound. The conclusion is still wrong, but the logic is sound.

## Instagram as the Second Pillar

The businesses that aren't beauty/wellness based, restaurants and bars, live on Instagram and Facebook.

They post daily. Photos of dishes, interior shots, weekend specials. Stories with live updates. DMs for reservations. The engagement is real. People comment, tag friends, share posts.

For these owners, Instagram is their website. Why pay for something static when you can post for free and reach customers where they already spend their time?

Again, the logic holds. A restaurant doesn't need online booking. They need people to show up. Instagram drives that better than a landing page buried on page 3 of Google.

## The Trust Gap

There's a third layer that took me longer to notice. Websites carry a credibility problem in Poland's SMB market.

Older demographics, which dominate small business ownership here, associate websites with either big corporations or scams. A local barber with a sleek website feels suspicious. Too corporate. Not authentic.

Instagram feels personal. Booksy feels utilitarian. A website feels like someone is trying too hard or hiding something.

I didn't expect this. In Western markets, no website is the red flag. In Poland's local service economy, having one can raise questions. "Why do you need this? What are you selling me?"

## Why They're Wrong (But Also Right)

Here's the thing. They're not entirely wrong.

If you're a nail salon with 200 regular clients who all book through Booksy, and your schedule is full most weeks, why burn money on a website? The return on investment is unclear. The effort to maintain it is real.

But here's what they're missing.

Booksy owns the customer relationship. Not them. If Booksy raises fees, they pay. If Booksy changes the algorithm, they adapt. If Booksy shuts down tomorrow, they lose their entire discovery channel overnight.

Instagram is even worse. You're building an audience on rented land. Algorithm changes, shadowbans, account suspensions. You have zero control.

A website is the only piece of digital infrastructure you actually own. It's insurance against platform dependency. It's leverage when Booksy tries to squeeze margins. It's the foundation for everything else, email lists, direct booking, content marketing, local SEO dominance.

Most importantly, it separates you from every other business stuck in the same Booksy/Instagram loop. When someone Googles "nail salon Częstochowa," the businesses with proper websites win. The rest don't even appear.

## The Opportunity

This is why I'm building them anyway.

The fact that Polish SMBs don't see the value is exactly why there's value in showing them. The market is underserved because the market doesn't know it needs serving.

My approach isn't to argue. It's to show. I build the website first, using photos from their Instagram and services from their Booksy profile. Then I show them what they could own instead of rent.

Some will ignore it. Some will dismiss it. But some will see it and realize they've been thinking too small.

That's the opportunity. Not convincing skeptics. Finding the 10% who are ready to see what ownership looks like.

## What I'm Learning

Prospecting these businesses taught me more about market psychology than any course or framework ever could.

People don't resist websites because they're uninformed. They resist because their current setup works well enough, and change introduces risk with unclear reward.

The businesses that will adopt websites aren't the ones doing poorly. They're the ones doing well and starting to feel the ceiling. The owner who wants to expand but realizes Booksy doesn't scale beyond one location. The restaurant that maxed out Instagram reach and needs another channel.

Understanding why they don't need websites is more valuable than explaining why they do. It changes how I pitch, what I build, and who I target.

## Where This Goes

I'm still early in this process. The AI system I wrote about in [my previous post](/en/blog/how-i-built-ai-system-find-polish-businesses) finds the prospects. But converting them requires understanding the mindset first.

Polish SMBs aren't behind on digital marketing. They've optimized for the platforms available to them. Booksy and Instagram work. Websites don't obviously improve on that equation.

My job isn't to fight that logic. It's to show what becomes possible when you own your infrastructure instead of rent it.

I'll write more as this evolves.
