I implement interfaces using proven UI patterns and component libraries like shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, with a strong focus on speed, SEO optimization, and scalability. I also integrate AI capabilities using OpenAI and Anthropic APIs—tools I've used in production to build features like smart content generation, automated workflows, and intelligent data processing. Design and branding are outside my scope — I focus entirely on development.",

            "question": "How are AI costs kept predictable and under control?",
            "answer": "AI costs are managed through caching, request limits, and only calling AI when it adds real value. Common results can be reused instead of regenerated, which significantly reduces usage. I also design features so costs scale with business value, not background noise."

I minimize what is sent, avoid unnecessary personal data, and follow provider privacy options where available. If strict data control is required, we discuss alternatives or limits before building anything."

            "question": "How reliable and accurate is AI in real products?",
            "answer": "AI is probabilistic, not deterministic, so it will sometimes be wrong or inconsistent. That's why I always build fallbacks, validation, and clear UI states for uncertain results. You should expect AI to assist and speed things up, not to be 100% correct."

Some models are better at structured classification, others at longer reasoning or safer outputs. I usually test providers on your specific use case and choose based on results, not brand names."
