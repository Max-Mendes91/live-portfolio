My work focuses on clean, maintainable code, strong performance, and real-world usability.",

I implement interfaces using proven UI patterns and component libraries like shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, with a strong focus on speed, SEO optimization, and scalability. I also integrate AI capabilities using OpenAI and Anthropic APIs—tools I've used in production to build features like smart content generation, automated workflows, and intelligent data processing.",
      "My process is structured and practical. I start with research—understanding the business goal, competitors, and technical requirements. Then I create low-fidelity prototypes in Figma to map user flows and features. After that, I build production-ready code using React and Next.js, handle deployment, optimization, and iteration based on feedback.",
