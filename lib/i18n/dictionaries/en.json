      "I'm not a designer or a branding specialist. I don't create logos or visual identities from scratch. My role is technical: I write code and turn ideas into working products. I implement interfaces using proven UI patterns and component libraries like shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, with a strong focus on speed, SEO optimization, and scalability.",
      "My process is structured and practical. I start with research—understanding the business goal, competitors, and technical requirements. Then I create low-fidelity prototypes in Figma to map user flows and features. After that, I build production-ready code using React and Next.js, handle deployment, optimization, and iteration based on feedback.",
      "I work with Polish businesses that need reliable websites or online stores, as well as UK and US companies looking for an offshore freelance developer. I'm fluent in English and comfortable working asynchronously across time zones."
