I build modern business websites, e-commerce stores, and AI-powered web applications for companies that need more than a basic template. My work focuses on clean, maintainable code, strong performance, and real-world usability.",
      "I'm not a designer or a branding specialist. I don't create logos or visual identities from scratch. My role is technical: I write code and turn ideas into working products. I implement interfaces using proven UI patterns and component libraries like shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, with a strong focus on speed, SEO optimization, and scalability. I also integrate AI capabilities using OpenAI and Anthropic APIs—tools I've used in production to build features like smart content generation, automated workflows, and intelligent data processing.",
      "My process is structured and practical. I start with research—understanding the business goal, competitors, and technical requirements. Then I create low-fidelity prototypes in Figma to map user flows and features. After that, I build production-ready code using React and Next.js, handle deployment, optimization, and iteration based on feedback.",
      "My biggest project, FlowMate, is an AI-powered email management platform that handles multi-platform broadcasting and smart content generation. It took 300+ hours to build and taught me how to architect production SaaS applications with authentication, payments, AI integration, and real user data at scale.",
      "I work with Polish businesses that need reliable websites or online stores, as well as UK and US companies looking for an offshore freelance developer. I'm fluent in English and comfortable working asynchronously across time zones."
