I implement interfaces using proven UI patterns and component libraries like shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS, with a strong focus on speed, SEO optimization, and scalability. I also integrate AI capabilities using OpenAI and Anthropic APIs—tools I've used in production to build features like smart content generation, automated workflows, and intelligent data processing.",

After that, I build production-ready code using React and Next.js, handle deployment, optimization, and iteration based on feedback.",
