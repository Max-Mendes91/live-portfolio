# How I Built an AI System to Find Polish Businesses Without Websites

I'm a freelance web developer in Częstochowa. My biggest challenge isn't building websites — it's finding businesses that need them.

Most Polish SMBs don't know they need a website. They run successful operations entirely through Facebook, Instagram, Booksy, or Google Business profiles. They have reviews, customers, and revenue. What they don't have is ownership over their online presence.

I built an automation workflow to find these businesses, research them properly, and reach out with something they can't ignore: a live mockup of what their website could look like.

This is how it works.

## The Problem I Was Trying to Solve

Cold outreach doesn't work when you say "Do you need a website?" Most business owners say no — because they're already visible on platforms.

But platform visibility isn't ownership. Facebook can change algorithms. Booksy takes commissions. Google Business profiles look identical to competitors. None of these build long-term SEO equity.

I needed a way to:

- Find businesses with proven demand (good reviews, active profiles)
- Identify which ones lack a real website
- Show them — concretely — what they're missing
- Do this at scale without losing personalization

Manual research takes hours per prospect. I automated it.

## Where the Leads Come From

I don't buy lists. Every lead comes from public, business-relevant sources:

- **Google Business profiles** — reviews, photos, services, hours
- **Booksy** — dominant in Poland for salons, barbers, beauty services
- **Facebook/Instagram** — activity, engagement, visual assets
- **Public directories** — industry-specific listings

The goal isn't volume. It's accuracy. I gather everything: services, pricing signals, location, images, reviews, contact methods. This data feeds every later step.

## Qualification: Who's Worth Contacting

Not every business makes sense to contact.

A prospect only qualifies if they pass strict criteria:

- Active online presence (recent posts, reviews, engagement)
- At least two valid contact methods
- Clear services and pricing signals
- Defined working hours
- No existing ranked website

Company size doesn't matter. Proof of demand does.

If required data is missing, the workflow stops. No guessing, no generic outreach.

## The Workflow (High Level)

I use OpenClaw as a 24/7 execution environment. The system runs while I sleep:

1. **Research agent** — gathers business data and assets
2. **Evaluation agent** — validates completeness
3. **Orchestrator** — approves or rejects the prospect
4. **Mockup agent** — generates a live website preview using real data
5. **Proposal agent** — creates a structured PDF in Polish
6. **Outreach agent** — drafts messages for email, Facebook, or Google

Each step depends on validated outputs from the previous one. Nothing proceeds on assumptions.

## The Mockup: Why It Works

When a salon owner sees a website with their real photos, their actual services, their reviews — they pay attention.

This isn't a template. It's their business, visualized as a website they could own.

The mockup is generated automatically from the research data. Same images they use on Instagram. Same services listed on Booksy. Same location from Google Maps.

They recognize themselves immediately. That's the point.

## The Proposal Structure

Every proposal is written in Polish with a fixed structure:

1. **Dlaczego strona internetowa pomoże Twojemu biznesowi**
2. **Co dokładnie oferujemy**
3. **Szczegóły inwestycji i wsparcia**
4. **Następne kroki**

No sales fluff. Educational, concrete, tailored to their specific situation.

## What I Learned

**What worked:**

- Time efficiency — research that took hours now takes minutes
- Consistency — every outreach is properly researched
- Immediate value demonstration — mockups start real conversations
- Higher response quality — people reply when they see effort

**What didn't work:**

- Some businesses still undervalue owned websites
- Education is still necessary, even with strong visuals
- Over-automation without strict quality gates kills credibility

The biggest lesson: **fewer, better prospects beat volume every time.**

## Compliance and Trust

This isn't spam. Key principles:

- Business-to-business only
- Low-volume, high-relevance
- Sent from my personal domain and accounts
- No scraping private data
- No misleading claims

When someone receives my message, they see a real person with a real website reaching out about their specific business. That's the difference.

---

## What's Next

I'm still iterating on this system. Response rates are improving. The mockup quality keeps getting better. Some conversations have turned into real projects.

If you're a business owner in Poland wondering whether a website is worth it — it probably is. And if you're a developer thinking about outbound — automation works, but only with restraint.

I'll write more as this evolves.
