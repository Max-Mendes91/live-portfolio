## YOUR HONEST POSITIONING

You're a **developer who handles the full process**:
- Research & gather inspiration from existing sites
- Prototype ideas in Figma
- Build everything with code
- Handle practical image work (compress, crop, optimize)
- Implement SEO and marketing strategies

**Honest way to frame this:**
- "Full-stack developer" (not designer)
- "I research, prototype, and build"
- "UI implementation" (not UI design)
- "Image optimization" (not photo editing/retouching)
- "Figma for prototyping" (not design from scratch)

## HONEST LANGUAGE GUIDE

### Say This ✓
- "Full-stack developer"
- "I research and gather inspiration"
- "Prototype in Figma"
- "UI implementation"
- "Image optimization"
- "I build SaaS and e-commerce"
- "SEO and marketing research"

### Avoid This ✗
- "Designer" (implies visual design specialty)
- "UI/UX Designer" (overclaims)
- "Photo editing expert" (overclaims)
- "Creative director" (not your role)

### Your Real Value Proposition:
**"I'm a developer who handles the full process - from researching ideas and prototyping to building production-ready code. I specialize in SaaS, e-commerce, and SEO-optimized websites."**

This is honest and still impressive because:
1. Full-stack is valuable
2. Research ability shows strategic thinking
3. Handling the whole process = fewer people to hire
4. Specific niches (SaaS, e-commerce, SEO) show expertise
